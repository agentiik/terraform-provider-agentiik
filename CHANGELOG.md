# Changelog

The releases of `terraform-provider-agentiik`.

Every repository of the project carries the same version and is tagged at the same moment, even where nothing changed, so an entry here may say that nothing was built. [Versioning](https://agentiik.github.io/docs#versioning) sets out why, and what a version promises before and after `1.0.0`.

`0.y.z` promises nothing beyond itself: what a release here describes may be gone in the next one.

## v0.1.1, 2026-09-13

This file, and nothing else.

`v0.1.0` was tagged before its changelog was written, and the fix for that is not to move the tag. Within minutes of the push, `sum.golang.org` had recorded the tagged commit of `agentiik` and `bricks` in a public append-only log and `proxy.golang.org` had cached it, so moving `v0.1.0` would have left `go get` serving the old code for ever and made a direct fetch fail with a checksum mismatch that reads as a supply-chain attack. A tag is a name somebody else pins, and a name that quietly comes to mean something else is worse than a second name.

So `v0.1.0` stays exactly where it is, describing exactly what it shipped, and this release adds the description. Every repository gets it at the same version on the same day, as every release here does. From now on a version's entry is merged before its tag is placed, which is written down in the conventions the documentation fixes.

## v0.1.0, 2026-09-12

Nothing is built yet. The repository carries its README, its licence and the shared instructions, and is tagged because every repository is.

The Terraform provider: namespaces, workflow repositories, grants, tokens and runs, as HCL. The roadmap says which release fills this repository: <https://agentiik.github.io/docs/roadmap>.
